Navigation and Mapping
#######################

Learning Objectives
===================

- To get hands on experience in assembling the platform and setting up the communication.

- Integration of perception data to map an environment and documenting the observed controllable and uncontrollable limitations.

- Using the map to localize and navigate to a goal pose and to understand the role of individual tuning the parameters. Documentation of controllable and uncontrollable limitations and their rectification.

- To build an application (eg: wall following task) by developing and integrating the perception and navigation modules. Documenting the challenges and possible solutions.
